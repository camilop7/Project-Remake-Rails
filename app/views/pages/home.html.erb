  <h2>THE PROGRAMME</h2>
  <p>Project ReMAKE and ReMAKE Educational are projects working in the Criminal Justice space seeking to help ex-offenders by bringing them into the wider society both in terms of business opportunity and education. The overall aim of these programmes is to create a community and a better understanding of formally incarcerated people and those with criminal convictions.
